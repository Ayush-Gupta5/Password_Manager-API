I developed a Password Manager RESTful API using Node.js, featuring JWT token authentication for secure access. 

## The API includes the following functionalities:
1. User Registration: Enables new users to create an account.
2. User Login: Authenticates users and provides a JWT token for secure sessions.
3. User Profile Management: Allows users to view and update their profile information.
4. Change Password: Lets users change their account password.
5. Forgot and Reset Password: Provides a mechanism for users to reset their password via email.
6. Save Passwords: Users can securely store passwords with details like title, username, password, and description. All password data is encrypted before being saved in the database.
7. Update Saved Passwords: Users can update the details of their saved passwords as needed.
